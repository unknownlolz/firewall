# Simple Firewall with Configuration Module

## Introduction
This is a simple Python script for a firewall with a configuration module. It allows you to define which IP addresses are allowed to access a system based on a configuration file. Additionally, it logs visits from allowed IP addresses along with their device information and the time of visit.

## Author
This firewall script was created by Darsh.

## How It Works
The firewall script consists of a Python class called `Firewall`. Here's how it works:

1. **Configuration Loading**: It reads the allowed IP addresses from a configuration file (`firewall_config.txt`).
2. **IP Address Checking**: When a request comes in, it checks if the IP address is allowed based on the configuration.
3. **Logging**: If the IP address is allowed, it logs the visit along with the IP address, device information, and time in a log file (`firewall_logs.txt`).

## Setup
To set up and use the firewall script, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. **Create Configuration File**: Create a file named `firewall_config.txt` in the same directory as the script (`firewall.py`). In this file, list the allowed IP addresses separated by commas.
   ```
   allowed_ips = 192.168.1.1, 10.0.0.1, 172.16.0.1
   ```
3. **Running the Script**: Run the `firewall.py` script. It will simulate incoming traffic, checking if IPs are allowed based on the configuration and logging the visits in `firewall_logs.txt`.
4. **View Logs**: After running the script, you can view the logged visits in the `firewall_logs.txt` file.

## Example
Here's how to use the firewall script:

```bash
python firewall.py
```

This will simulate incoming traffic, checking if IPs are allowed based on the configuration and logging the visits in `firewall_logs.txt`.

## Customization
You can customize the firewall behavior by modifying the configuration file (`firewall_config.txt`). Add or remove allowed IP addresses as needed.
